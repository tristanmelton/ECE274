Phase Stretch Transform (PST) is an operator that finds features
in an image. PST takes an intensity image I as its input, and returns
a binary image out of the same size as I, with 1's where the function
finds sharp transitions in I and 0's elsewhere. PST function is also
able to return the detected features in gray scale level (i.e.
without thresholding).

In PST, the image is first filtered by passing through a
smoothing  filter followed by application of a nonlinear
frequency-dependent phase  described by the PST phase kernel. The
output of the transform is the  phase in the spatial domain. The main
step is the 2-D phase function (PST phase kernel) which is typically
applied in the frequency domain. The amount of phase applied to the
image is frequency dependent with  higher amount of phase applied to
higher frequency features of the  image. Since sharp transitions,
such as edges and corners, contain  higher frequencies, PST
emphasizes the edge information. Features can be further enhanced by
applying thresholding and morphological operations. For more

PST function is developed in Jalali Lab at University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA). PST is a spin-off from research on
the photonic time stretch technique in Jalali lab at UCLA. More
