# Instructions for Python 3.x 

## Prerequisites
You can install most of the following packages using pip.
* NumPy
* Python Imaging Library (PIL)
* Matplotlib
* Itertools
* Mahotas 

## Remarks
Mahotas library is needed to implement morphological operations and display overlay in case of digital edge detection (if Morph_flag==1).

## Testing
Put your test images in the Test_Images directory and then, set the file path in the code on line 70. You can also pass the filename using the command line [Uncomment lines 64 and 72 and comment line 70].
The images can be color or greyscale. However, PST operation occurs on color images only after converting them to greyscale. You can change the filename in the test_script_PST.py code to run the algorithm on the test image. 

## Visualization
The code uses matplotlib and mahouts to visualize PST edge map and overlay (in case of digital edge). [See section # Display results in test_script_PST.py]

## Test Results
The PST edge map and overlay (in case of digital edge when Morph_flag==1) are saved in the Test_Images folder. [See section # Save results test_script_PST.py]
