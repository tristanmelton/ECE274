## Instructions

Image processing toolbox is needed to run this function, function has been tested on MATLAB R2013a on a computer with Windows 7, 64-bit operating system.  The code uses IMOVERLAY function developed by Steven L. Eddins for visualization of detected features. 
The test image is loaded in line #8 in the test_script_PST.m file. The test images can be called from the Test_Images directory and then, set the file name in the code on line #8. 
The images can be color or greyscale. However, PST operation occurs on color images only after converting them to greyscale. 

## Copyright
PST function  using MATLAB is developed in Jalali Lab at University of California,  Los Angeles (UCLA).  PST is a spin-off from research on the photonic time stretch technique in Jalali lab at UCLA.  More information about the technique can be found on our group  website: http://www.photonics.ucla.edu
